<h2>The Mess is a four piece songwriting and music production team based in Stockholm, Sweden.</h2>
<blockquote>We met at Musikmakarna, Songwriters Academy in &Ouml;rnsk&ouml;ldsvik and found that the differences in our musical backgrounds were an advantage when it came to music production and songwriting.</blockquote>
<p><em>The Mess</em>  was recently formed but has already had some success such as a release with <em>Emerentia</em> with the song Wasting water, songs to be released with <em>Salvatore Ganacci</em> and the Taiwanese artist <em>Genie Chou</em>, songs on hold with <em>Taped Rai</em>, <em>Anders Bagge</em>, <em>Maryjet</em>, <em>The Kennel</em> and the Japanese boyband <em>Kat-tun</em>.</p>
<blockquote>We feel like this is the beginning of something great and that the next step should be Los Angeles. Our minds are set and our goals are solid!</blockquote>
